As an Application Developer at Sasquatch Studio, I leverage my expertise in Full Stack development and Devops to create innovative solutions for Shopify merchants. I design and deploy CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Heroku, ensuring seamless integration of supplementary fees into storefronts. I also collaborate with clients to translate business needs into technical solutions, enhancing compliance and user experience.

Previously, I worked as an Application Developer at BC Pension Corporation, where I developed a Microsoft Power App utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to reduce application processing time from 1 week to 3 hours. I also implemented CI/CD GitHub Actions pipelines to deploy power apps applications in multiple environments. I hold a Master of Science in Computer Vision from Simon Fraser University and a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from SRM University. I am passionate about applying my skills in computer science, machine learning, and deep learning to solve real-world problems.
